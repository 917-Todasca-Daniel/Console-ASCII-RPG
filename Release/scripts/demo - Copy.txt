What if you lived in a fantasy world, but it was not the dream life you would have hoped for? Instead, it was a mess of an ASCII game, started by a highschooler and finished by a first year college student. Shucks.
In this mess of a game, you are a mercenary living in Amarino. Think medieval, but not too medieval. Think a large continent, but not too large. Is there anything beyond Amarino? You don't know for sure, because you never afforded to care about it. You were born in a village of Human farmers, but a great war traded the gift of childhood innocence for famine. You were ten when you saw your life burn in flames of many colors. You became a mercenary because you needed the money and because you realized you were darn good at it.
If you thought that's enough of a tragic backstory, I forgot to tell you that you're a mute. The gift of speaking was taken away from you by a witch when you failed to complete her contract. You still remember how she did something horrible with her hands, and the next think you know, you're down on the floor gasping for air. You try to scream, but you can't. You try to feel your voice, but instead there's void. Many years, you tried to track down the witch again, force her to give you her voice back. You paid good money for other witches to do the same. But you were never the same again. 
The title of a mute mercenary has a nice ring to it, but you figure if it's the fantasy world life you have imagined. A life where nothing is guaranteed, and nothing can be said about it.
The morning of two days ago, you set road to complete an exotic contract you had on your list for weeks. A young man with bloodshot tired eyes came to complain to you about Ghosts haunting him wherever he went - you even talked to some of the Ghost themselves! - and requiring you to retrieve an artifact from the sealed tombs of the last living Queen. Ghost contracts are nothing that usual, and they have good pay, but you had to prepare for the road and for whatever might happen. Bandits take refuge in the Mountains, and old castles are a hotspot for other hostile looters or magic cults.
You spent the last two days crossing the Misty Mountains while singing at the guitar you've looted a couple months ago, it was good practice! Near noon, you've started seeing the walls of the castle on the horizon, so you paddled the guitar back as to not attract bandits, and hurried your step. In less than a hour, you've climbed the stone cold walls to get inside, checked for recent human activity, and started looking for the entrance door. This is no large castle, and you had no idea from outside what riches it still has; but you are surprised you never heard anyone talking about it before.
You practically stumble upon the castle entrance after hitting your leg on a fallen boulder. It is a large, old, wooden door, on top of a dozen of marble stairs. More than twice your height, the door is a little hard to pull open. Its handle is cold to the touch, and the wood creak as if it was wailing.

~inspect mirror$inspect paintings$go east$
Finally, you are inside the castle. The entrance hall is still well-lit by the light outside, so you get a full view of its riches. The stone walls are comically tall - you could perhaps fit an old tree inside. The walls are cluttered by the grilled windows, unlit lamps, and large paintings. A silver mirror on the northern wall in the middle of the hall is shining bright. The entire hall is crossed by a large red rug to the east, where another wooden door is carved in the shape of a flower. Definitely a long way to go until you find the tombs.
!paintings1
You take a second to look at all the many paintings in the hall - at least a dozen from your count. They're all larger than the most you could ever carry. Most are anonymous, but on others you still find the painter's name and year of work, written in the smallest of sizes: Morgan 850, Morgan 850, Morgan 851, Morgan 857, Morgan 870, Morgan 900, Camila 907, Camila 910, Camila 920, Morgan 935, Ramone of the Seas 940, Morgan 950, Morgan 1072. Some were portraits of hunters and their captures or of soldiers riding to battle; some were landscapes simmilar to what you've seen on the way there, while some where still lifes. The most surpising one was Ramone's, presumably a gift of peace from another Kingdom - it featured a Human knight with his face covered and an Elvish princess handshaking in their armor. 
!mirror1
~leave the mirror be - there's nothing of use to it$look at yourself in the mirror$
The mirror stands proudly on the wall. It's covered in dust, but it still looks like a fine piece of work. A golden snake with shiny scales twirls around its edges, his two saphire eyes at the top piercing the innermost parts of your soul.
!mirrorchoice2
~fix your hair$same tired old face$
?xyzmirror
You clean part of the thick layer of dust with your hand, and see yourself better than you ever did before. What say you?
!mirrorchoice1
?xyzmirror
Moving on...
!fixmirror
You fix your hair, enjoying a healthy dose of narcissism and... wait, is there something behind your back?
!joke_mirror
Just kidding! I'm an unreliable game narrator. There's nothing behind your back. It's just a little insulting how much time dialoguing with a mirror took you...
!mirror2
The mirror sits proudly on the wall. How many have passed around this mirror before, never looking for a second at its reflection?

~inspect mirror$inspect paintings$go east$
You currently are at the entrance of the castle, which must have been crowded with people in its days, but now feels empty and void of all life. The walls are cluttered by the grilled windows, unlit lamps, and large paintings. A silver mirror on the northern wall in the middle of the hall is shining bright. The entire hall is crossed by a large red rug to the east, where another wooden door is carved in the shape of a flower.

You walk to the door cautiously, expecting traps or pressure plates. The only bad think that happened to you instead was choking on the dust that rised from the rug. This place seems far more welcoming that you would have expected.

?dining
[1 0
You are inside what seems a large dining room of the castle. The walls are not as tall as the entrance hall, but the rooms trades up height for width. A beautiful mosaic window on the northern wall picturing an spearman angel fills the room with dim yellow light. The empty dining table is thin, but still fits a couple dozen of chairs. Cups and plates fill the shelves on the other walls, and you also notice a grandfather clock in the southwestern corner of the room. A part of you is amused at the idea of a lowly mercenary like you attending a royal banquet here. 
!cellar
[1 1
The many stone cold steps prove to be a deceptively long descend, giving you a long time to think about what's going on. The stair twists and turns around, almost getting you dizzy. It gets darker and darker, so you immediately light up the torch halfway through.
It is a great relief when you finally get at the end, reaching what seems to be a cellar. The chill in the air is only partially fend off by your torch. Up ahead, you notice some woode barrels and boxes, but you have no idea how many they are or how big the cellar may be.
You think of exploring ahead, but that's when a horrifying sound breaks the illusion of silence you felt so far. A terrible crash, sounding like a mountain split itself in two, echoes the cellar room from the dark ahead. Once it's over, you start hearing footsteps, and the sound of someone breathing heavily.
*Write what you want to do.*hide*sing|play guitar*nothing|wait*fire
!promptcellar
Torch in hand, guitar on your back, and dagger at your belt - what will you do?

!servant_nothing
You think and think, turning your mind upside down for what your best move would be. And finally, you come up with.. nothing. You just sit there, frozen in the dark like a drunk duck, waiting for something to happen, as the footsteps get closer and closer to you. How did you get hired for this job, again?
Shaking in your botos, the footsteps ahead get louder and louder. The whole cellar seems to shake with every step. You soon are able to make up a large sillhouete in the dark, but are not even sure if it's humanoid. It comes towards you in the shape of a large boulder, and it breathes heavily. 
It feels like years until it finally gets in the light of the torch, realizing you will have to switch 'it' for... 'they'. They are indeed a humanoid, but like something you have never seen. What seems to be a human made out of stone sits in front of you, or rather an uncanny abomination of rock with human features. Likely twice your height and width, it stares as you from above, as also you do.
!servant_sing
You light off your torch, take the guitar that's strapped on your back into your hands and, nervous as you were, with hands shaking and with increasingly louder steps coming towards you from ahead, you start playing a melody. You play as if your life counted on it - because it strangely does. Strumming your hands violently on the guitar at first, it takes a while for you to calm your nerves and pick up the pace in a morbid case of stage fright. You play a tavern ballad you've heard many times before, and after what must have been a whole minute of playing, you realize you hear no footsteps anymore.
BRAVO! BRAVO! We have some amazing guests at the castle today!
I think I have heard this song before. It sounded like your life depended on it!
What seems to be a human made out of stone sits in front of you, or rather an uncanny abomination of rock with human features. Likely twice your height and width, it stares as you from above, as also you do.

!servant1_fire
You throw the torch, trying to hit one of the barrels, in hope it will catch fire. You don't know what might happen next, but you just pray for the best.
As you threw the torch, you caught a glimpse of a foreing sillhouete. Or rather a large stone boulder? Then the torch landed inside a barrel, immediately creating an explosion with what was inside, making multiple barrels catch fire. You hear screaming from whatever was inside the room with you, and the sound of woods being smashed to the walls. Each barrel that was on fire was picked up from the ground by that strange sillhouete and thrown to the back of the cellar, in an attempt to put off the fire. You swear some of the splinters flown all the way to your ears, but you didn't get hurt at all.
Now left in the dark, you light up another one of your torches, and just wait for the aftermath.
RUDE! That was uncalled for! It will take me a long time to clean this up!

As it is the protocol for guests... I salute you. I am the servant of this castle. I hope you will excuse what happened moments ago. You see, I was sleeping and I forgot what... my figure looks like. I think you have a lot of questions, so let's just talk for a while. Please, take a seat!
~point towards your throat that you are a mute$
Their voce is an interesting combination of guttural speaking and rocks grinding on top of each other. It's like an extreme case of dry throat. The collosal pile of deformed rock and stone also points at a wooden box for you to sit, and you immediately comply. It is just right for you height, and it makes up nicely for a chair. They bring another large wooden box near you for them to sit on.
The creature takes a long look at you, puzzled by what you are doing. You point time and time again at your throat, throwing other hand signals in the air to get a clue. It's times like these you feel you have no place in the world, other than being a killer.
?{servant2
Making fun of me and of my large neck... alright. Have it your way. It's quite funny, I finally have another alive person in front of me, but all I get are silence and mocks. Just please leave this place, I can't help you loot this castle even if I wished.
The servant's reply just makes you bow your head down in sadness and anger. With no idea how to get your point across, you think it's best you actually left. Don't want a large creature like them to be mad on you. Before you actually get up, all of a sudden, a flash of recognition appeared on the rocky eyes of the golem. Their stone face muscles tensed with an audible rock rumble in a curious smile and there appeared a certain human sparke in their marble eyes.
!{servant2
Lords, are you a mute? I took it all personal... that was terrible. My apologies. Do you know how to write?
Again, more frustration than you could ever express. It's rare not to meet a person that doesn't know how to read - and you do it for your contracts almost everyday. No one taught you how to write, though. You only make things up when writing, it is barely intelligible. To answer the Golem's question, you shake your head for an yes, then for a no.
!{servant2
I do not understand. Do you know how to write or not? Well, no matter, at least try to. Can you try to carve-write on this box so I can see?
You nod and actually apreciate the Golem's idea. Feeling conscious about yourself, you sketch on the box 'who are you'? It looks like you put more letters than it is supposed to be, and the Golem takes a while to think about you writing, but they finally understand.
?{servant2
Good question. Maybe a better one at this point would be 'what am I'? I am what happens when a servant follows their others. For others, I am a coward, and for others, a freak. The true story is that Our Queen ordered me to follow a daylong ritual here in the cellar, with no idea what purpose it was for. She told me I had to do it in silence, and in silence I did it. It made me fall asleep for God knows how long, and when I woke up, I was changed. Transformed into what you see now - a rock golem.
?{servant2
!svq3
~*s1*what is 'Golem'?$*s2*where are others$*s3*why not leave?$
I was a Human before. Now, I am stone. Am I Human still? I don't know. I can barely remember my life as Human anymore.
!svq3_1
?{servant2
?xyzs1
Golems are simply Human souls that are placed inside inanimate objects. The ritual I did transferred my consciousness into a pile of rocks from this cellar. It's not that bad, you know: I love my stone muscles. I don't need to eat, and I require very little sleep. I can shapeshift, and I'm virtually immortal. But at the same time... how would you feel if you lost your body, lost a part of what you are, and got something you never wished for in return? I look at my reflection in the water barrels of the cellar and... I hate what I see. When I put my hands on my skin, I don't feel a pulse or a heartbeat. I am for most other people a monster - the first look you gave me told me everything.

So, my life as a Golem - not that great. I had enough time to accept it, but I wish for my body back still.

?xyzs2
Everything is still foggy... I can barely recall what happened with my Queen.
?{servant2
I was cleaning the dining room, right upstairs from here, making sure everything is alright, taking out the dust, when I get summoned by my Queen to the throne room. I take my distance, I bow towards her, but she tells me to stand up and listen carefully to what she has to say.
?{servant4
She tells me about this ritual and gives me all the instruction on paper. The ink was like nothing I have ever seen before. I do not dare to ask more about it, I just comply. She also gives me a set of keys for the castle, and asks me again for my allegiance to the Kingdom. Before I left the throne room to go to the cellar, she tells me to be patient and wait as much as it is necessary.
!srv2
~*s1*how is living as a golem?$*s2*how did you get abandoned by everyone?$*s3*why don't you leave?$
?{servant2
I have waited and waited for many years. I can't even tell for how long, but it must be at least a century. Yet I have never seen anyone walk this castle or come to me in this damp cellar. You are the sole exception. 
!svq3_3
?{servant4
?xyzs3
The ritualic transformation bound me to this cellar and it completely stops me from leaving. It is a curse. If I tried to make a step away from this cellar on the stairs, I get dizzy, and I get the worst fever, which is making me feel like my head explodes. The most I could climb were the first ten steps, before I felt like my entire mind was eaten away by vultures. I just cannot climb away from this dark cellar. I'm stuck here.
!svqx
~handshake his large stone hands$go for a hug!$
After saying that last phrase, the creature's face got more tense and tense, from your ability to read the servant's stone muscles. You think about a lot on your mind - part of you feels like the Golem is complaining a lot. Another part of you think all this is unfair. Part of you shames the servant for the naive obedience to his Queen. Well, not that you could say anything about that.
!servant_hug
You stand up and put your hands around the rock servant. You are afraid to cut your clothes in the sharper edges of the rocks, and your hands barely reach around his back, but there you are, hugging an abominable pile of stone. They soon laugh, and embrace you with their large hands. It feels more like being stuck in a mountain avalanche than a hug, yet you understand their intention. You go back to sit on your box as if nothing happened.
!servant_shake
You stand up and put your hand on display for a handshake. At first, the rock servant tries to clumsily get their hand around your fingers - but it's too large! You start worrying if all that stone might cut your skin. But no matter, they just take your hand and wrap it around theirs, shaking a couple of times. Even though their stone is stone cold, it was the warmest handshake you ever gave, and your hand was more than unharmed.
!servantserious
?{servant2
Thank you for that! Part of my job of servant is to read people. I have served countless guests from countless corners of the world. I started geeting a feel for people. I realize what you came here to do - you're looking for something in this castle. You're a mercenary. I honestly don't care what you want to do, but it doesn't seem like you're only looking for chaos. I don't see any reason to stop you, in the state that I am. I'm going to give you the keys of the castle, so you can be on your way to search for what you need. It's also this castle's best shot, maybe you will find out what happened.
!asktime
After saying that, the golem eagerly hands you three colored keys on a metal ring. Like everything in this castle, they are elaborately crafted - the red key's handle portrays a rabbit, another is a green hand, and yet another is a blue crown.
!keyoffer1
?{servant2
?xyzkeys
Here are the keys to the castle. Just try them around the handles of the castle; most doors are colored for the right key, so you don't waste time. I forgot why we had this system in place, but I wrote a verse about them! Listen up:
?{servant4
#If you're blue, try to split yourself in two!
?{servant5
#If you're green, wander carefree in the ravine!
?{servant
#If you're red, well, you may think of doing bloodshed.
?{servant3
#But how about you open the door, instead of another one's skull?
?{servant2
This was one of my first attempts and I was still learning how to rhyme, you know. Empires aren't built in one day.
?{servant5
Off you go, then! Come and ask me anything if you ever need help around the castle, I know each and every corner of it!
!servantfinal
You turn your back to the rock servant, who's saluting you with a great smile on their face. Not much happened in regards to your quest, but your steps are not as careless or violent as before.
